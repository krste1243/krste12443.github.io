    <p>
        Other than programming I love working with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Flash.
        I am also into vocal mixing, making beats and creating covers for songs or albums.
        Have done few logos for companies.
        I can say that I am a passionate reader. I love thrillers, especially Dan Brown's books, Steve Berry's and a lot of others.
        When I have free time I go hiking or I can ride a bike for a couple of hours.
